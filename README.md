# Qcover
Qcover is an open source effort to help exploring combinatorial optimiaztion problems in Noisy Intermediate-scale Quantum(NISQ) processor. It is developed by the quantum operating system team in Beijing Academy of Quantum Information Sciences (BAQIS). Qcover supports fast output of optimal parameters in shallow QAOA circuits. It can be used as a powerful tool to assist NISQ processor to demonstrate application-level quantum advantages.
