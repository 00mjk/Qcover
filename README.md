# Qcover - A QAOA based combinational optimization solver
Qcover is an open source effort to help exploring combinatorial optimiaztion problems in Noisy Intermediate-scale Quantum(NISQ) processor. It is developed by the quantum operating system team in Beijing Academy of Quantum Information Sciences (BAQIS). Qcover supports fast output of optimal parameters in shallow QAOA circuits. It can be used as a powerful tool to assist NISQ processor to demonstrate application-level quantum advantages. 


# Getting started
To start using Qcover, simply run
```
python -m pip install --user qcover
```
More example codes and tutorials can be found in the tests folder here on GitHub.

Also, make sure to check out the detailed code documentation.
